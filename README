This is a SDL2-based implementation of a audio synthesizer.

Available interaction control-keys:

 * <ESC> - quits program

The dependencies are modest:

 * cmake 2.8.12
 * C++-14 compiler (e.g. g++, clang++)
 * SDL 2.0.5

It compiles and runs under recent Linux-distributions (e.g. Ubuntu 16.04). It
should run with little or no changes under MacOS X and Windows 7 (or more 
recent) too. But that has not yet been tested. Feedback and patches are
welcome.
